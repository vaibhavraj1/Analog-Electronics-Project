# Analog-Electronics-Project
This is the project that I made for my subject Analog Electronics (3rd semester) in my undergraduation.In this project, we have created a Burglar Alarm System using IC 555 Timer. 
This Powerpoint Presentation is a detailed explanation of all the components, working and calculations involved, along with the circuit involved. 
In the end, there is also a glimpse of the actual working of the alarm system on the Proteas Software, that is, how it looks like actually , and how it works.
